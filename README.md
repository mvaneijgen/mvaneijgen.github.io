====================

My portfolio website build with Jekyll and some help of [this demo](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/12/18/perspective-page-view-navigation/), Also thanks to [@chriscoyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) and [@katiekovalcin](https://twitter.com/katiekovalcin) for uploading [this jykell project](https://github.com/katiekovalcin/kovalcin) to Github to learn from. 

I used the following tools for this project.

* [Sublime text 3](sublimetext.com/3) - Main code editor.
* [Grunt](gruntjs.com) - For compiling Jekyll and merging SVG files.
* [jekyll] - Static site generator 

All of the above programes I never or hardly used before, but the goal is to learn something new and trying to make the switch from the conventional programs.
