# Katie Kovalcin’s Spectacular New Website

Katie Kovalcin is pretty cool. Cooler than most people. But her website sucks. This is a better one.

We only actully use the `gh-pages` branch here, so this `master` branch is empty.
=======
The repo for Katie Kovalcin's personal site.

You'll need two command line thingies open.

1. Type `grunt serve` into one and it'll run the server.
1. Type `grunt` into the second one which will do everything and kick off the watching
1. Go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)
1. Might as well kick on the [LiveReload browser extension](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-)
